              over almost every single website we use are not selected at random.
              Our data collected by big social media networks are bought and sold
              specifically for the purposes of selling us more products. Products
              that companies are pushing onto us by referring to the data they have
              bought on us. Sometimes this might feel useful like seeing and ad from
            a product we had looked up before. But what about negative behavior?
          Behavior that you don't want to be sold on? The new difference is that
        instead of seeing these toxic ads on billboards they might be directly pushed
      to us all over the internet! </p>

          problematic ads similar to the one above and on the right. But what if
        these ads are pushed onto the pages of people struggling with an eating
      disorder, specifically because they have an ED. We don't know the keywords
    that an algorithm might pick up to offer us up these kinds of ads. Then push
  us into performing our worst impulses or trigger our mental disorders...</p>
