          <h3>Toxic Activity Spilling Out</h3>
              <p>
              Tumblr has been a place for expression and sharing but that means
                for negative behavior as well. There is a huge community of eating
              disorders especially anorexia.
            </p><br><br><br><br>
          <h3>Does This Activity Turn Up In Other Corners of the Internet?</h3>
            <p>This community around EDs has become so toxic that Tumblr started
            changing the platform in the recent years. However, people just started
          using different words and tags. But since what we search for ends up in
        in front of us at every turn of the internet, does the algorithm feed our
      negative behavior as well. As someone that has consumed the content of this
    toxic Tumblr community, I would often get ads about Diet Pills or products of
  Diet Culture even when I didn't search for them. I felt as if the internet fed
into whatever behavior it could latch onto even negative ones... </p>
